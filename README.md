# Defensive-Approximation
Implementation of our proposed defense strategy against adversarial attacks "Defensive Approximation (DA)"

A Pytorch code for our [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3445814.3446747). It includes the implementation of:

*   Our proposed approximate multiplier (Ax-FPM)
*   Approximate convolution layer
*   Approximate fully connected layer 
*   Tutorials on how to implement approximate CNN models

Note: for faster computation of convolution layers, we recommend using the Joblib Parallel tool (commented code in the approximate convolution layer) and Multiple Core CPU.
